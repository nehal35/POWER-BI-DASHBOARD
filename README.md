The Customer Churn Analysis project is a study conducted to understand and predict customer churn within a bank. It involves the following steps:

## Project Steps
**1. Data Collection:** Relevant customer data, including demographics, account information, transaction history, and customer interactions, is gathered for analysis.\
**2. Data Exploration:** The collected data is analyzed to identify patterns and trends associated with customer churn, such as account closures or customers switching to another bank.\
**3. Feature Selection:** The most significant factors influencing customer churn, such as customer age, account balance, transaction frequency, or customer service interactions, are determined.\
**4. Visualization:** Visual representations, such as charts or graphs, are created to present the insights derived from the data exploration phase, making it easier to comprehend churn-related patterns.\
**5. Insights and Recommendations:** The findings are interpreted to gain insights into the key drivers of customer churn. Actionable recommendations, such as targeted marketing campaigns or improved customer service strategies, are provided to mitigate churn.\
